## Hi there 👋

🌷I'm Mita, a data analyst based in Indonesia

📊I analyze data and turn them into data-driven decisions!

🤔I input my projects here if I have ideas that pop into my head. My best one so far is my [airline customer segmentation](https://github.com/mitadian/airline_customer_segmentation)

⭐My interest is in e-commerce, and I am skilled in data preprocessing, data processing, data analysis, and machine learning with tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

🔥I am currently improving my skills in machine learning, and I'm open to collaborations. Do not hesitate to contact me!
